# Two-step penalised logistic regression for multi-omic data with an application to cardiometabolic syndrome
This is the accompanying code for Cabassi et al. (2020). It is based on the code Zhao and Zucknick (2020) available at https://github.com/zhizuio/IPFStructPenalty/ . Part of this code was used for the multi-omic analysis of Seyres et al. (2020).
